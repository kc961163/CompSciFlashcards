# Web Development Project 3 - Flashcards For CS

Submitted by: Krishna Choudhary

This web app is an interactive flashcards quiz designed for computer science enthusiasts. Users can test their knowledge by entering guesses for various CS-related questions before revealing the answer. The app provides immediate visual feedback on whether an answer is correct (with fuzzy matching to account for slight differences), and it tracks both the current and longest streaks of correct responses.

The quiz includes intuitive navigation through back and next buttons, along with a shuffle feature to randomize the order of the cards. Users also have the option to mark cards as mastered, removing them from the active pool and adding them to a mastered list.

Additional enhancements include a polished start page that outlines the app's purpose and a final end screen that summarizes the userâ€™s performance with metrics like current streak, longest streak, and the number of mastered cards, plus an option to restart the quiz.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total
